# Hotel Booking Status Prediction

## Overview
This project involves developing a machine learning model using XGBoost to predict the booking status (canceled or not canceled) in a hotel reservation dataset. The model achieves an impressive 93% accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness in understanding and predicting guest behavior.

## Features and Data Preprocessing
- Detailed feature engineering was conducted to enhance model performance.
- Key features include guest details, booking characteristics, and other derived metrics.
- Data preprocessing steps like handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting data into training and test sets are documented.

## Model Training and Evaluation
- An XGBoost classifier was trained on the preprocessed dataset.
- The model was evaluated using a hold-out test set, achieving an accuracy of 93%.
- Techniques like cross-validation were used to ensure model robustness.




## Future Work
- Plans for deploying the model into a real-time hotel booking system.
- Strategies for continuous monitoring and model updating.
- Further analysis for additional business insights.
